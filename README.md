### Title of Report: Comets and Their Connection to the Origin of Life on Earth

## Abstract
Comets are fascinating astronomical objects, as they provide a deep insight into
the Earth’s history. A well-studied example is 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P),
the focus of Rosetta’s soft landing mission in 2014, in which the amino acid glycine
was unambiguously detected for the first time. Rosetta’s findings are presented here
in the broader context of cometary studies and the search for the origin of life on
Earth. Identifying organic compounds and elements essential to life suggests that
comets could have supplied the Earth with various prebiotic chemicals. Moreover,
comets contain water, although studies of hydrogen isotopes showed comets were
not a significant source of the Earth’s oceans, compared to asteroidal planetesimals.
Further research into comets is likely to reveal more about the formation of the
Solar System, with a multitude of spacecraft missions currently being planned to
investigate the beginnings of life on Earth.
